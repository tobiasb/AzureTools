## renameKudoLogFiles.py

Renames the files in your `dump-10-18-21-49-08\LogFiles\http\RawLogs` from something like `0e5d49-201710181010.log` to something like `2017-10-18_1010_0e5d49.log` so it can be sorted. That makes it easier to find the latest one among hundreds of files.

Usage:
`renameKudoLogFiles.py <path to http logs>`
